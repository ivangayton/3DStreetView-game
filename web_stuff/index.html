  <h1>Welcome to 3DStreetView!</h1>
  
<p>These are immersive environments ready to explore like a 3D game. They are created by local people in low-income environments, primarily using simple equipment (locally-purchased mobile phones or consumer-grade drones) and Free Software.</p>


  <p>In other words, everything you see here can be done without expensive hardware or software!</p>
  <p>All games open in a new tab.</p>
  <p>DESCRIPTION OF ENVIRONMENT, AND WHILE YOU ARE AT IT ADD SOME EXPLANATION OF HOW IT WAS CREATED</p>
